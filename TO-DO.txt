TO DO FOR WEB-APP

1. Make the wishlist show that it is empty when it's empty, even if the user just migrated/removed a product
2. Make the get_cart function into a decorator that you can pass into all your views
3. Implement the 'remove from wishlist' functionality
4. Make the 'migrate from cart' functionality not to add quantity to the cart item (default action) if the item already exists in the cart. (You can do this by setting quantity=0 if item-class exists in the DOM or cart parent element.)
Let the software be for only technology products

Let the categories be for:
Phones
Laptops
Refurbished Goods

Let there be specific information for each product when their category is selected e.g. ram, phone brand, model, rom, battery life, etc with help text

This info will be displayed when a user is about to purchase

Your reference should be ebay/bestbuy/walmart (I don't know which)

Let there be advantages for CD and for flash drive
