TO DO FOR WEB-APP

1. Make the wishlist show that it is empty when it's empty, even if the user just migrated/removed a product
2. Make the get_cart function into a decorator that you can pass into all your views
3. Implement the 'remove from wishlist' functionality
4. Make the 'migrate from cart' functionality not to add quantity to the cart item (default action) if the item already exists in the cart. (You can do this by setting quantity=0 if item-class exists in the DOM or cart parent element.)
